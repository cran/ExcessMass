Description: Implementation of a function which calculates the empirical excess mass 
	for given \eqn{\lambda} and given maximal number of modes (excessm()). Offering 
	powerful plot features to visualize empirical excess mass (exmplot()). This 
	includes the possibility of drawing several plots (with different maximal 
	number of modes / cut off values) in a single graph.
